# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
The weather dashboard was created so that a user could find the weather in a given location. The weather for the current date is highlighted by being in a larger box at the top of the page. While the 5-day forecast is below allowing the user to plan ahead. 
The user is able to quickly recheck previous cities as they are stored in local storage so they can be quickly retrieved.
